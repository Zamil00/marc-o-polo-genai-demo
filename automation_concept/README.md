# Automation Workflow Concept (GenAI + Business Integration)

This module documents a practical automation concept for fashion retail workflows, inspired by common GenAI enablement patterns:

**New product created → AI generates copy/metadata → content routed to tools → teams notified → review & publish**

## What’s included
- `workflow.md` — end-to-end workflow, tools, governance, KPIs
- `architecture.png` — visual workflow diagram

## Why it matters
This shows **business integration** capability beyond model calls:
- clear process design
- human-in-the-loop approval
- safe deployment & logging
- measurable impact (time saved, content consistency)
